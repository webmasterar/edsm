## Installation requirements

You need to have a Linux system with an up-to-date C++ compiler like g++ (version 4.7.3 or better) installed.

You need to install glibc and zlib installed; dev versions may be required.

If you are working with compressed vcf files, you may need to install Tabix to create the tbi files.

Only then can you run ./pre-install.sh && make.
